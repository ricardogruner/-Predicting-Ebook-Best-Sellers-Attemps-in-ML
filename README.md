# -Predicting-Ebook-Best-Sellers-Attemps-in-ML

I came across this dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-kindle-books-dataset-2023-130k-books/data 

This was a cool little job to practice data preparation, exploratory analysis and look for patterns and relationships between features.
After that, I tried logistic regression, decision tree and random forest to try and predict BestSellers. Due to issues in the data quality, the results were not satisfactory.
I decided to keep the models anyway, just to document my approach. Maybe in the future I'll decide to dedicate a few more hours to this notebook, but for now it's time to move on to another project.

Please note that I don't know how accurate is this database.
